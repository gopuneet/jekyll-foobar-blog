Continuing with **Ruby on Rails** to create a sample blog app.

`:variable` is a **symbol**, ie, an immutable string in Ruby.
### Ways of signifying a Hash
  
* `:variable => "something"` is a Key/Value pair.
* `variable: "something"` is also a Key/Value pair!

### Q. Difference between:

* `http_basic_authenticate_with`
* `authenticate_with_http_basic`
* `authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic?`

### Basic Authentication from following the [guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
Basic Authentication has following code in ArticlesController:
```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
 
  http_basic_authenticate_with name: "dhh", password: "secret", except: [:index, :show]
 
  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end
 
  # snippet for brevity
```
This makes the user provide Authentication twice, first when clicking new/edit article (method `new`/`create` is called) and a second time after clicking create in the `articles/new` or `articles/edit` (method `create` is called).  
The `except:` part should have `:create` too like:
```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController

  http_basic_authenticate_with name: "dhh", password: "secret", except: [:index, :show, :create]

  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  # snippet for brevity
```
After that the user is asked to enter name/password when creating, editing, deleting article only once during the process.
