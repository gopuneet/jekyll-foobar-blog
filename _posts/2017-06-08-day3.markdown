Starting with **Ruby on Rails** following the [guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) to create a sample blog app.

### Rails and Routes
`./welcome/index` calls the welcome controller's index method whereas `./articles/` calls the articles controller's index method.  
This is can be understood by checking the `routes.rb` file:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index', to: 'welcome#index'
  resources :articles
end
```
The `resources :articles` automatically routes `articles#index` to `./articles/`.  
We can modify the welcome routes as follows to make it `./welcome/` as follows:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome', to: 'welcome#index'
  resources :articles
end
```
### [`form_for`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.1.0/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_for) to create forms
The following two forms:
```ruby
<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>
```
and:
```ruby
<%= form_for @article do |f| %>
```
have the same functionality because `@articles` redirects to `articles_path`'s' url itself.
