Exciting first day at work!  
I was asked to go through the modules on [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/) and familiarise myself with the Ruby programming language.

Coming from a C++ background, I had my fair share of troubles getting used to nuances of the language such as accidently using `{}` when Ruby used `end` indentifier to enclose and separate blocks.

### The `if`-`else` construct in Ruby was of the form:
``` ruby
if condition
  # snippet for brevity
elsif condition
  # snippet for brevity
end
```
Looks fine on the first look, eh? Look again, it's `elsif`, not `elseif`!  
It was slightly confusing and made me wonder why the ruby devs had it like that ([they do know how to spell :P ?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13550407/does-elseif-still-exist#comment50635437_1355042)) but after reading [this thread on ruby-forum](https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/100350) and the response of [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto), the chief designer of the Ruby programming language, I understood the reasoning behind the decision.  
>Correct or not, I chose 'elsif' as the shortest correct pronounceable word for 'else if'  
-Yukihiro Matsumoto.


### Calling Ruby methods with parameters, consider:
``` ruby
def method(param)
  # snippet for brevity
end
```
When calling the method you can use:
```ruby
method(param) #works
```
or:
```ruby
method param #works too
```
but using the following causes an error:
```ruby
method (param) #causes error!
```
We can either use `space without the braces` or `braces without the space` but **not** both.


### No need of Return statement!
The fact that Ruby **automatically returns** the last evaluated expression from a method pleasantly surprised me and made me wonder why other languages didn't have it as well!

I was able to finish one module, [Ruby Primer](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer) and start the next module, [Ruby Primer: Ascent](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent) by the the end of day.
