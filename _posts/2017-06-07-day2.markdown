Continued with the second module [Ruby Primer: Ascent](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent) on day 2 which delved deeper into the intricacies of the language.

### `attr_accessor` in Ruby
It implements both `attr_reader` and `attr_writer` for the same variable.  

It is also important to note that using `attr_accessor` can be harmful:

### Classes and three types of variables:  
#### Instance variables `@iv`
They are bound to an instance of a class and together forms what we call the state of an object. Every instance of a class has a different set of instance variables. 
#### Class variables `@@cv`
Class variables can be used to store data that belongs to a class, but not to its instances.
#### Class instance variables `@civ` 
Even though the notation is confusingly similar to a normal instance variable, the difference here is that `@civ` is initialized directly in the class body and is accessed only from class methods.  

## Setting up the workstation:  
Everything went smoothly until MongoDB. It took around an hour and various stackoverflow fixes to try to make it work with the Ubuntu 16.10 on my system.
It finally worked but all the various fixes left many duplicate and redundant files on the system and it stopped working after leaving from work.
I removed everything and did a fresh install while documenting every step.
